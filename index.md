# Re-exam preparation

During the spring semester 2024 we offer 6 days where you can get a brush up lecture and assignments in the various topics that we have reviewed throughout the semester. 

There will be about 1.5 hours of lectures followed by 2.5 hours of exercises in R007 in building 303A. There will be TAs for all of them, as well as new exercises so that you can practice both learning the basics, but also questions that could be on the exam.
