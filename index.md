# Brush-up course

### Tentative Schedule

During the spring semester 2024 we offer 6 days where you can get a brush-up lecture and assignments in the various topics that we have reviewed throughout the semester. 

Each day, there will be a lecture (in Danish) lasting approximately 1.5 hours. The lecture will be followed exercises, with TA help available, for the rest of the day. We have prepared new exercises, so that you can practice both learning the basics, but also questions that could be on the exam.  

Place: **R007 in building 303A**.
