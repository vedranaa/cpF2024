# Brush-up course

During the spring semester 2024, we offer a *Brush-up course* for students preparing for re-exam in the course *02002 Programmering* and *02003 Computer programming*. The *Brush-up course* consists of lecture and assignments in the topics from the programming courses. The *Brush-up course* is scheduled for 5 Saturdays during the semester, and a final Sunday just few days before the re-exam.

For each day of the brush-up course, there will be a lecture (in Danish) lasting approximately 1.5 hours (13:00 - 14:30). The lectures will not be streamed, but will be recorded.

The lecture will be followed by exercises, with TA help available for 2.5 hours (14:30-17:00). Each day, the lecture will have a special focus, but exercises will cover more varied parts of the course. We have prepared new exercises, so you can both refresh the basics, and try problems similar to what could appear on the exam.

# Announcements

**Date: 9/4 - 2024**

Dear all,

We have recieved a couple of messages regarding streaming, video recordings and the exercises, and this message should clear most of it up for all of you. Firstly, the course is *not* streamed, as the infrastructure is not built for us to do this. Along with this, video recordings sadly have not worked the first 3 times, so we have decided to stop this, as it does not work. Lastly, some of you have asked for solutions for the exercises. These will be uploaded onto this website as a zipfile filed with solution files. There are no notations to these solutions and they will first be uploaded about a week after the lecture.

Hope this helps clear up any questions, and otherwise write me a message at [s194113@dtu.dk](mailto:194113@dtu.dk).

Sincerely,
Nicolai Amin
